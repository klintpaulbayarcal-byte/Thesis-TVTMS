# PR readiness

Match the requested milestone: local validation, PR publication, or merge
readiness. For local work, remote gates are not applicable. Reuse a completed
review for the same unchanged diff; do not start another review merely because
this skill was loaded after the repository's review gate already passed.

## Workflow

1. Read the applicable repository instructions, requirements, accepted plan,
   and current task status.
2. Inspect the branch, worktree, untracked files, and complete diff. Separate
   unrelated pre-existing changes from the requested change.
3. Run focused checks, then the repository's complete required local gate.
   Record exact commands, results, skipped checks, and residual risk.
4. Run the built-in local Codex review after the complete local gate passes:

   ```bash
   codex review --uncommitted
   ```

   Let the review finish. Verify every finding against the current diff, fix
   only actionable defects, add regression coverage when practical, rerun
   affected validation, and repeat `codex review --uncommitted` until no
   actionable findings remain. Explain verified false positives without
   changing correct code. A review-mode Codex instance must report findings
   directly and never launch a nested review. If Codex review is unavailable or
   fails, report it as a readiness blocker instead of substituting a third-party
   review CLI.
5. Commit, push, or open a pull request only when the user authorized those
   state changes. Open a ready-for-review pull request by default. Create or
   leave it as a draft only when the user explicitly requests a draft. If known
   gates or required manual tests remain, stop before opening the pull request
   and report the blockers instead of using draft state as a holding area.
6. For a published PR, verify checks and reviews against the latest commit.
   Inspect thread-level resolution state rather than relying only on flat
   comments. For a contributor-fork PR, read
   [references/contributor-forks.md](references/contributor-forks.md).
7. For merge readiness, require an independent review of the current change.
   A completed independent Codex review can supply that evidence unless the
   repository requires an additional reviewer or human approval. The builder's
   self-review and green CI do not replace an independent review.
8. Complete and document the repository's manual-test checklist on the real
   target environment when practical.
9. Recheck the final diff, required checks, reviews, and unresolved threads
   after every push.

## Hard gates

Do not report a pull request as ready to merge while any of these remain:

- required CI is failed, pending, missing, or attached to an older commit
- actionable review feedback is unresolved
- the Codex review loop or a required independent review is incomplete
- required manual testing is incomplete or undocumented
- the branch contains unrelated changes, secrets, debug code, or generated junk
- planning documents no longer match the implementation

Do not perform the merge unless the user explicitly requests it.
Never fabricate commit hashes, review state, commands, or test results. For
uncommitted work, report `HEAD` together with worktree and untracked-file state.
When no pull request exists, report remote checks, reviews, threads, and PR
status as not applicable.

## Pull request evidence

Ensure the PR records:

- the problem and implemented approach
- important decisions and deviations from the plan
- exact automated checks that passed
- manual tests and their environment
- screenshots or recordings for visible changes
- known limitations, skipped validation, and follow-up work

## Final report

Report `HEAD`, worktree and untracked-file state, changed-file scope, local
checks, manual-test state, and remaining blockers. For a published pull request,
also report its latest commit, remote checks, review state, unresolved threads,
and whether it is draft, review-ready, or merge-ready.
