# Codex configuration layout

## What Codex loads automatically

Codex automatically discovers a limited set of files:

| Purpose | User scope | Repository scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instructions | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` from the repository root to the working directory |
| Configuration | `~/.codex/config.toml` | `.codex/config.toml` in trusted projects |
| Skills | `~/.agents/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` from the working directory to the repository root |
| Rules | `~/.codex/rules/` | Project rules next to an active trusted `.codex/config.toml` layer |

Codex does not recursively read arbitrary files under `docs/`. A loaded
`AGENTS.md`, selected skill, or user prompt must point Codex to the relevant
document.

## Why this repository is not a full home-directory mirror

The active `~/.codex` directory mixes portable configuration with private and
ephemeral runtime state. Examples include:

- `auth.json`
- installation identifiers
- session transcripts and history
- SQLite state and write-ahead logs
- model and application caches
- downloaded plugins
- shell snapshots

Tracking or replacing those files would expose credentials, create noisy
changes, and make the setup less portable.

This repository manages only:

- global instructions
- user configuration defaults
- optional local model profiles
- command rules
- reusable skills
- an opt-in list of recommended plugin selectors

The installer links instructions, rules, profiles, and skills into their
documented locations while preserving runtime state. It renders
`~/.codex/config.toml` as a regular file so it can add machine-specific trust
entries for `~/github` and every Git worktree discovered beneath it. Existing
notification, plugin, marketplace, hook-state, notice, local Node REPL, and
runtime shell-environment settings are carried forward into the rendered file.
With the explicit plugin option, it asks Codex to install each selector from
`codex-plugins.txt`; it does not link or track the resulting plugin cache,
authentication, or connector state.

## GitHub project trust

Codex project trust uses exact absolute project paths. A parent project entry
and wildcard entries do not automatically trust nested repositories. On each
run, the installer adds the current user's `~/github` path plus every Git
worktree found recursively below it to the generated config. Rerun the
installer after adding repositories to refresh those entries.

## Plugins and MCP servers

Run the installer with `--plugins` on Linux or macOS, or `-Plugins` on Windows,
to install the selectors in `codex-plugins.txt`. Without that option, plugin
state is untouched. Restart Codex or start a new session after installing a
plugin so its bundled skills and tools can load.

Plugins can package skills, connectors, MCP servers, hooks, and other assets.
Standalone services such as Context7, Playwright, and Chrome DevTools are MCP
servers, not entries managed by this repository's plugin manifest. Configure
those separately when a project needs them.

## Local model profiles

Codex profile files live directly under `CODEX_HOME` and use the name
`<profile>.config.toml`.

This repository includes:

- `ollama.config.toml` for Codex's built-in Ollama provider.
- `llamacpp.config.toml` for a local llama.cpp Responses API endpoint.

Profiles layer over `config.toml` only when selected with `--profile`, so local
model settings do not affect ordinary Codex sessions.

## Skill location migration

Older local layouts may place skills under `.codex/skills`. Current Codex
documentation uses `.agents/skills` for user and repository skills. This
repository uses `.agents/skills` as its canonical location.

## Direct `CODEX_HOME` use

Do not point `CODEX_HOME` at this repository. Codex writes runtime state into
`CODEX_HOME`, while this repository intentionally separates managed files from
runtime data. Use `scripts/install.sh` on Linux or macOS and
`scripts/install.ps1` on Windows instead.

## Verification

After installation, restart Codex and ask:

```text
List the instruction sources and relevant skills active for this repository.
```

The expected instruction order is:

1. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
2. the repository root `AGENTS.md`
3. any closer nested `AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.override.md`
